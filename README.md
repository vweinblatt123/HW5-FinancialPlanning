# HW5-FinancialPlanning

Note, my "today" is 1/26/21, so I pull intraday prices for the Personal Finance Planner and use 1/25/16 to 1/25/21 for the five years of data in the Retirement Planning section. For the Optional Challenge, I 1) run over 5 years using the same 60/40 portfolio but increase the initial investment to $60k and 2) run over 10 years using a 50/50 portfolio and $60k initial investment.
